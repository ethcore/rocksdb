Description: RocksDB development files
  RocksDB is an embeddable persistent key-value store for fast storage. It
  builds on LevelDB to be scalable to run on servers with many CPU cores, to
  efficiently use fast storage, to support IO-bound, in-memory and write-once
  workloads, and to be flexible to allow for innovation.
  .
  This package contains include files and the static library shared by RocksDB-based libraries.
